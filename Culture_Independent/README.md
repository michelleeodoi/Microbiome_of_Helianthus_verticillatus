# This directory contains the scripts and figures from the culture-independent (i.e., amplicon sequencing of fungal ITS2 and the V4 region of the 16s ribosomal RNA (rRNA) for bacteria and archaea) section of the project
## To maximize the coverage of microbes:
### A pool of six forward and two reverse ITS primers was used to amplify the ITS region of the fungal taxa (White, et al., 1990;Cregger, et al., 2018).
### A pool of four 515F and one 806R primers was used to amplify the 16s V4 rRNA region of archaeal/bacterial taxa (Cregger, et al., 2018).
